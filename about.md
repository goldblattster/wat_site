## About

<p style="text-align: center">**Problem Statement**</p>
The United States currently faces a recycling crisis. China has recently restricted the import 
of certain recyclable material, such as mixed paper and most plastics. Consequently, the market 
for recyclable material has dramatically shrunk. Recycling facilities across the country have 
been unable to sell the material they collect and sort. If these facilities cannot find a buyer 
for their recycling, the material will simply be sent to a landfill.
    In Santa Cruz county, the Santa Cruz Resource Recovery Facility is no longer accepting
recycling from UC Santa Cruz. Not only has it been more expensive for the recovery facility to 
operate due to lower demand for recyclables, but the material that is coming from UC Santa Cruz 
is polluted with waste. The campus population has been unable to distinguish between recyclable 
and non-recyclable items. As a whole, it has also improperly sorted trash into the respective 
waste bin. These problems have manifested in our recycling streams becoming contaminated with 
non-recyclable material. It has become so costly for them to deal with the material we deem as 
recyclable that the resource recovery facility is better off not taking our recyclables in the 
first place.


<p style="text-align: center">**What We Are Doing About It**</p>
In order to raise awareness and clean up our recycling streams, an interdisciplinary team of 
computer science, sustainability studies, and art students is designing and building an 
interactive and educational mobile game to raise awareness and influence detrimental consumption 
and disposal habits practiced by many members of the UCSC campus community. Adopting an 
enigmatic “dungeon crawler” strategy set in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the development team 
is committed to keeping the gameplay dynamic and fun while depicting a strict allegiance to 
current recycling policies and standards. Adopting sentiments represented by the larger “serious 
gaming” movement the team expects prospective players to experience more than entertainment when 
they download this free mobile app. Game mechanics introduce players to concepts like 
“pre-cycling” as they roam through different places on the hunt to collect and stockpile 
discarded materials. A triage incentive, integrated into the character’s “backpack” inventory, 
teaches players the value of sorting materials before trading them in. The game is being 
assembled on a Unity platform and will be playable on IOS and Android.
