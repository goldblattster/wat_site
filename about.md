    In order to raise awareness and clean up our recycling streams, an interdisciplinary team of computer science, sustainability studies, and art students is designing and building an interactive and educational mobile game to raise awareness and influence detrimental consumption and disposal habits practiced by many members of the UCSC campus community. Adopting an enigmatic “dungeon crawler” strategy set in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the development team is committed to keeping the gameplay dynamic and fun while depicting a strict allegiance to current recycling policies and standards. Adopting sentiments represented by the larger “serious gaming” movement the team expects prospective players to experience more than entertainment when they download this free mobile app. Game mechanics introduce players to concepts like “pre-cycling” as they roam through different places on the hunt to collect and stockpile discarded materials. A triage incentive, integrated into the character’s “backpack” inventory, teaches players the value of sorting materials before trading them in. The game is being assembled on a Unity platform and will be playable on IOS and Android.
