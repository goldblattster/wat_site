The University of California Office of the President has set a goal for 
all UC campuses to go waste free by 2020. Currently, UC Santa Cruz diverts
around 60% of its waste away from landfills (Historical). It would seem
that the university is narrowing in on their goal, yet with less than a
year to go there is still a significant amount of work to do. Unbenounced 
to almost all of the campus population, the Santa Cruz Resource Recovery 
Facility will no longer accept our waste. The material that people put in 
the campus recycling bins is either too contaminated or not recyclable in 
the first place. It will be impossible for UC Santa Cruz to go waste free 
by 2020 if the Santa Cruz Resource Recovery Facility continues to reject 
our waste.

In order to clean up our recycling streams, the Without A Trace team
is designing and building an interactive and education mobile game to 
teach the campus population how to properly recycle. The game will be 
playable on IOS and Android. The team chose to develop a mobile game 
because they are massively popular with college students. Lectures or 
fliers would be ineffective as the student body would not be as receptive 
to those medium as they would an application on their phones. Given that 
adults in their early 20s spend a sizable chunk of their day on their 
phones, utilizing some of that screen time to a fun game with recycling 
themes could change their recycling habits.
